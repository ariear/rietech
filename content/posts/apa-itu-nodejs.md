P채채bo and his colleagues made a series of seminal discoveries that included sequencing the entire Neanderthal genome less than a decade after the publication of the first human genome and discovering a new type of ancient human, the Denisovans, who were a sister group to the Neanderthals. Their findings showed that modern humans intermingled with Neanderthals and Denisovans to a significant degree. Some of the ancient gene variants that we acquired from them are more frequently present in certain modern populations. Their existence helps to explain, for example, why some people are better at fighting off certain viruses and why some are better adapted to living at high altitudes.

Before the discoveries by P채채bo and his colleagues, most of our knowledge of ancient hominins and our evolution came from analyses of bones and artifacts found around the world, such as the Neanderthal bones that were first discovered in
