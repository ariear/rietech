Halo perkenalkan nama saya arie akbarull ridho , seorang pelajar dari smk teknologi balung , pada kesempatan kali ini saya akan memberikan tutorial cara membuat website statis dengan hugo

But because genetic material is fragile, most of the DNA discovered in ancient bones is highly degraded, chemically modified and tainted with contamination. Through many years of persist effort, Pääbo developed a series of new techniques that made it possible to extract, duplicate and read the broken DNA to reconstruct the original genomic content. In the process, he established the new scientific discipline of paleogenomics

Pääbo and his colleagues made a series of seminal discoveries that included sequencing the entire Neanderthal genome less than a decade after the publication of the first human genome and discovering a new type of ancient human, the Denisovans, who were a sister group to the Neanderthals. Their findings showed that modern humans intermingled with Neanderthals and Denisovans to a significant degree. Some of the ancient gene variants that we acquired from them are more frequently present in certain modern populations. Their existence helps to explain, for example, why some people are better at fighting off certain viruses and why some are better adapted to living at high altitudes.

Before the discoveries by Pääbo and his colleagues, most of our knowledge of ancient hominins and our evolution came from analyses of bones and artifacts found around the world, such as the Neanderthal bones that were first discovered in 1856. “Many questions, however, could not be answered by analysis of ancient bones and artifacts alone,” said Wedell during the Nobel Prize announcement ceremony. 

Through new sequencing technologies and advanced computational analysis, and with the help of an international group of collaborators, Pääbo proved that it is possible to sequence DNA from 40,000-year-old-bones. In 2010, he and his group published the first full sequence of the Neanderthal genome, a feat that was once considered impossible. The Neanderthal genome resurrected a missing piece of the history of our ancient ancestors. His findings revealed, for example, that there was gene flow between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, meaning that they once intermingled and had children.
